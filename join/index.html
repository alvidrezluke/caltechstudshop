How to become a Student Shop Member:

<ol>
<li>Fill out our <a href="contact.html">member contact form</a> so that we can add you
to our mailing list and files.</li>

<li>Make sure you have the appropriate training for tools you have used. For the
metal shop, you must have had outside training on a lathe and mill, and welding
if you plan to use the welders. In addition, you must attend a metal shop orientation
to become familiar with our specific shop.
For the wood shop, you must attend our wood training/orientation.
In both cases, you need to fill out a Proof of Training [ <a href="Proof_of_Training.pdf">PDF</a> ].
This needs to be signed and dated by the appropriate trainer.
</li>

<li>You must read, sign, and submit the liability release
[ <a href="Release_Student_Shop.pdf">PDF</a> ]
and the Student Shop Member Rules
[ <a href="Member_Rules.pdf">PDF</a> ]
to the Student Shop committee.</li>

<li>You must pay the appropriate dues. This can be done either by filling out the
Payment Form [ <a href="Payment_Form0809.pdf">PDF</a> ]
allowing us to charge to your account or by mailing a check to the Student Shop.
Membership dues to the student shop are as follows:<br><br>
Current Caltech Students: $20/term<br><br>
Everyone else: $30/term UNLESS you choose to sign up for a full year (4 terms)
at the START of that year (beginning of fall term), in which case the fee is $20/term. For the remainder
of the 2017-2018 academic year the cost is $20/term for all members who join
during this sign up period (meaning you complete the training sessions and
become an active member within the beginning of this term)</li>

<li>Mail any applicable (signed and completed) documents or checks to the Student Shop mailbox:<br><br>
<b>Student Shop<br>
Caltech MSC 526<br>
Pasadena, CA 91125<br><br></b>
</ol>
<p>Upon completion of all of these steps, you will be notified and your Caltech swipe card/ID will
be activated so that you will have access to the Student Shop.  A violation
of any of the rules of the Student Shop will result in immediate de-activation
of your card.</p>
<p>These procedures are a work in progress. If something confuses you or you have
suggestions for us, please send an email.</p>
