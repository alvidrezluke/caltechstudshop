            <h2>The Caltech Student Shop is currently in the process of reopening and is not accepting members at this time. Please contact us for the latest information at <a href="mailto:studshop@caltech.edu">studshop@caltech.edu</a>.</h2>
            <h2>How to become a Student Shop Member:</h2>
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Fill out our <a href="contact.html">member contact form</a> so that we can add you to our mailing list and files.</li>

                <li>Make sure you have the appropriate training for tools you have used. For the metal shop, you must have had outside training on a lathe and mill, and welding if you plan to use the welders. In addition, you must attend a metal shop orientation to become familiar with our specific shop.
For the wood shop, you must attend our wood training/orientation. In both cases, you need to fill out a Proof of Training [ <a href="2023ProofOfTraining.pdf">PDF</a> ]. This needs to be signed and dated by the appropriate trainer. </li>
                
                <li>You must read, sign, and submit the liability release [ <a href="Release_Student_Shop.pdf">PDF</a> ] and the Student Shop Member Rules [ <a href="Member_Rules.pdf">PDF</a> ] to the Student Shop committee.</li>

                <li>You must pay the appropriate dues. This can be done either by filling out the Payment Form [ <a href="2023PaymentForm.pdf">PDF</a> ] allowing us to charge to your account or by mailing a check to the Student Shop. Membership dues to the student shop are as follows:<br><br> Current Caltech Students: $20/term<br><br> Everyone else: $30/term UNLESS you choose to sign up for a full year (4 terms) at the START of that year (beginning of fall term), in which case the fee is $20/term. For the remainder of the 2017-2018 academic year the cost is $20/term for all members who join during this sign up period (meaning you complete the training sessions and become an active member within the beginning of this term)</li>

                <li>Mail any applicable (signed and completed) documents or checks to the Student Shop mailbox:<br><br><b>Luke Alvidrez - Student Shop<br> Caltech MSC 133<br> Pasadena, CA 91125<br><br></b>
            </ol>
            <p>Upon completion of all of these steps, you will be notified and your Caltech swipe card/ID will be activated so that you will have access to the Student Shop.  A violation of any of the rules of the Student Shop will result in immediate de-activation of your card.</p>
            <p>These procedures are a work in progress. If something confuses you or you have suggestions for us, please send an email.</p>
