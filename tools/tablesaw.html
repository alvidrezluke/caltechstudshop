<p>Table Saw Safety Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the blade is clean, sharp, and not missing teeth. </li>
<li>Keep your hands out of the path of the blade, and use a pusher for small pieces </li>
<li>Unplug the saw when changing blades or performing maintenance </li>
<li>Have a support (like a table) at the end of the saw for long pieces of wood, and make sure
the wood will not hit the support.</li>

on the saw. </li>
