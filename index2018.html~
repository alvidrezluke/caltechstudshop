      <p>The Student Shop is a community-run shop located on the
Caltech Campus.
We offer a variety of wood- and metalworking equipment. Membership is
very
inexpensive, on a per-quarter basis. </p>
      <p>Members: Please continue to report incidents such as any kind
of mess that has not
been cleaned up, broken tools, worn blades, or unsafe behavior as
soon as possible. This helps the committee keep the shop useful, clean,
and
safe for members. Incidents of irresponsible behavior will be recorded
as an example of what not to do. This log of incidents will be
posted under the Rules and Safety section of this site.</p>
