            <p>The Student Shop is a community-run shop located on the Caltech Campus. We offer a variety of wood and metalworking equipment. Membership is very inexpensive, on a per-quarter basis.</p>
            <p>
                Members: Please continue to report incidents such as any kind of mess that has not been cleaned up, broken tools, worn blades, or unsafe behavior as soon as possible. This helps the committee keep the shop useful, clean, and safe for members. Incidents of irresponsible behavior will be recorded as an example of what not to do. This log of incidents will be posted under the Safety section of this site.
